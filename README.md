# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

===============================================================================

## My approach

 I created 4 folders.
  assets - includes the images of the requirements
  Resources - contains my cities csv file and the converts city.html file
  visualizations - contains the pictures from the homeowrk.
  WebVisualizations - contais the 7 web pages
    Index.html - main page
    cityvscloudiness - page on the cloudiness plot
    cityvshumidity - page on the humidity plot
    cityvstemp - page on the temp plot 
    cityvswind - page on the wind plot
    comparison - page with all four plots to compare
    data - page with the city data

I ended up using my own data from the homework and ran it through the jupyter notebook to create an html file.  I imported that into the web page data.html cleaned up the html table headers and made it responsive.  

The main pages I followed the images granted my green is slight different, and made them responsive the screen size.

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `Web-Design-Challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the web challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: **WebVisualizations**.

4. Add your **html** files to this folder as well as your **assets**, **Resources** and **visualizations** folders.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

6. Deploy to GitHub pages. 

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
