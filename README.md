# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

===============================================================================

## My approach

 I created 4 folders.
  assets - includes the images of the requirements
  Resources - contains my cities csv file and the converts city.html file
  visualizations - contains the pictures from the homeowrk.
  WebVisualizations - contais the 7 web pages
    Index.html - main page
    cityvscloudiness - page on the cloudiness plot
    cityvshumidity - page on the humidity plot
    cityvstemp - page on the temp plot 
    cityvswind - page on the wind plot
    comparison - page with all four plots to compare
    data - page with the city data

I ended up using my own data from the homework and ran it through the jupyter notebook to create an html file.  I imported that into the web page data.html cleaned up the html table headers and made it responsive.  

The main pages I followed the images granted my green is slight different, and made them responsive the screen size.

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignments. Specifically, I plotted [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
